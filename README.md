Reaver-Wrapper
==============

ABOUT: This Tool is a wrapper for the reaver WPS Attacking Toolkit Why this tool? reaver is great, but there is no automatic way to prescan,decide and start the attack. This is the reason why I wrote NWRW - Net-War Reaver Wrapper. This code is not the nicest one, i know, but hey it't working and helps! Have fun.
